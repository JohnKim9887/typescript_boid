# TypeScript Boids Simulation

Live demo: https://johnkim9887.github.io/typescript_boid/

Boids is a swarm simulation that models flocking behavior using a few simple rules. Each **boid** follows:

1. **Separation** — avoid collisions with nearby boids.
2. **Cohesion** — steer toward the average position of nearby boids.
3. **Alignment** — steer toward the average direction of nearby boids.

## Hunters

I also added a few **Hunter Boids** (large red boids) that chase the flock, and updated boids to avoid them.
